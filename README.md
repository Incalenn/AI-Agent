## 📌 Introduction  

In the realm of technology and evolution, AI has been a predominant subject, shaping various industries and innovations. Over time, AI has evolved, gaining trust worldwide through continuous advancements. A mainstream example is **ChatGPT by OpenAI**, based on the **GPT-4o LLM**, or **DeepSeek**, which was trained using OpenAI’s models.  

Millions of users interact with AI daily—generating images, writing essays, conducting research, and much more.  

As we enter **2024-2025**, a new AI paradigm has emerged: **AI Agents**.  

### 🔹 What are AI Agents?  

AI Agents are autonomous software programs designed to perform tasks or solve problems by perceiving their environment and acting upon it. You might already be using AI Agents daily—**Alexa, Siri, Google Assistant**—without even realizing it.  

### 🔹 Key Characteristics of AI Agents  

- **Autonomy** – Operate without continuous human intervention.  
- **Perception** – Gather and analyze data from their environment.  
- **Decision-Making** – Act based on predefined rules, AI models, or learned behaviors.  
- **Action** – Execute tasks, make recommendations, or interact with the environment.  

### 🔹 Types of AI Agents  

- **Virtual Assistants** – Siri, Alexa, Google Assistant.  
- **Recommendation Systems** – Netflix, Spotify, YouTube’s content suggestions.  
- **Autonomous Vehicles** – Tesla’s self-driving technology.  
- **Customer Support Bots** – Automated customer service chatbots.  

AI agents are now embedded in daily applications, enhancing automation, personalization, and decision-making.
